# grayscale_converter
Simple Python OOP grayscale converter. Can only read PIL image objects, but it shouldn't be too hard to implement other image processing library support. 

## How to use
The GrayscaleConvert class holds two methods, `convert_num` and `convert_image` and takes a PIL image object as a constructor parameter.
### `convert_num`
Converts to a matrix of RGB values representing a gray RGB value based on the chosen algorithm. It takes one parameters:
  * algorithm: string, determines the algorithm to generate the grayscale values, defaults to "average"
    * "average" for averaging out the RGB values
    * "highest" for the highest value out of the RGB values
    * "upper_average" for the average of the two highest values of the RGB values
    * "middle_average" for the average of the highest and lowest values of the RGB values
   
Returns a list of height * width dimensions.

### `convert_image`
Takes the already grayscaled numerical image matrix (generated by `convert_num`) and turns it into a .png file. It takes two parameters:
  * numerical_matrix: list, matrix of grayscaled image data (typically generated by `GrayscaleConvert.convert_num()`)
  * fname: string, image saved with this file name

Generated image is saved at fname.
